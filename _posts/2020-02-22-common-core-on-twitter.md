company_description: During the November 2014 election the public debate around Common Core State Standardswas starting to get fairly loud. I collected tweets about the Common Core from the week of the election to see what I could learn about the debate.
team:
stack: Twitter API, Python, iPython Notebook, Gephi
contribution:
- Captured 41,000+ tweets that contained the words “common core,” “commoncore,” or “ccss.” from 21,000+ users over the course of November 2014.
- Identified topics and sides of the debate using graph analysis of users connected to the words they used to talk about the CCSS and social connections, defined by follows, between the users from my CCSS data set.
