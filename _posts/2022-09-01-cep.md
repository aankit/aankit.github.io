company_description: Annually all NYC Department of Education schools, except for charters, bring together a team of folks to write Comprehensive Education Plans (CEPs) that describe their programming, staffing, budgeting, compliance, etc. in a range of different areas important to their superintendents and the city. These plans are made public as PDFs by the DOE - [learn more here](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/get-involved/families/school-leadership-team/comprehensive-education-plans).

The time, effort, and specificity of the data in these plans have led me to believe it should be open (machine-readable) so it can be analyzed and used in analyses by researchers and practioners and potentially be made legible for current and prospective teachers, school leaders, parents, and anyone else that is impacted by our public schools. I partnered with folks at the Robin Hood Foundation to investigate the data I had liberated and its uses. Our findings we published in an open access journal and the code for the [web app](https://github.com/aankit/cep-access) and [intial scraping of a decade of CEPs](https://github.com/aankit/cep-analysis) is on Github.
team:
stack: Bash, Python (PDFminer, Flask, SQLAlchemy), PostgresQL, ElasticSearch, 
contribution:
- I scraped all the PDFs, broken them into pages, converted them into searchable text, and stored them in a database so users could search any text and all instances would be returned by year with links to the human-readable PDFs.

- Conducted analysis with summer fellows at the Robin Hood Foundation in NYC that was used for exploratory analysis around literacy and math curriculum in use. This initial analysis may have played some part in the Foundation coming to support initiatives in the city around high quality instructional materials. Or not, who knows!

- Co-authored a journal publication describing the tool and an exploration of how it was used by and what it revealed for program officers in philanthropies with Dr. Steve Azeka and Kenji Kanamaru.
