company_description: In 1945, Vannevar Bush, a defense engineer, hypothesized about ‘memory extender’ machine that would give us an 'enlarged intimate supplement to one’s memory'. Memix questions the idea that troves of easily consumed media can be considered an ‘intimate supplement to one’s memory’.

contribution:
- Developed two methods for randomly mixing photos from three events from my first marriage - engagement ceremony, engagement photo shoot, and wedding - to represent how my memories ran together and develop meaning through the process of recalling them in relation to each other.
