company_description: Duchamp said that “I have come to the conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.” Most beginners to the game never see the artistry or poetry of the game because of fear. These two projects explore how technology might change learners' relationship with this complex game.
team:
- 
stack: Arduino + multiplexers, Processing(Java)
contribution:
- Built a screen-based game in Processing and a physical chess board that both helped new chess players to learn the rules of the game by playing the game
- Playtested screen-based game to understand if chess learners understood and enjoyed the game based on the visualizations of all potential moves available
- Received a NYU Prototyping Fund grant to buy materials for physical chessboard and presented at the Fund's showcase at NYU Tandon in Winter 2013.
