company_description: What if we enabled teachers to evaluate themselves, privately, without judgement,and to do so on a daily basis. Aha! is a smart camera that gives teachers the power to quickly gather video of themselves based on specific questions they have about their teaching practice and privately view and reflect on auto-edited clips.
team:
stack: Raspberry Pi, PiCamera, the Picam library, Shell, Python Flask, Javascript
contribution:
- Researched the history of audio, video, and electronic media in teacher education and professional development in the United State and abroad, specifically finding Deborah Ball's book *Teaching, Multimedia, and Mathematics* illuminating.

- Built a portable camera that captured continuous audio and video saving video only during specific times scheduled by teacher or indicated by teacher in the moment using front-end application.

- Set up the camera to have a private wireless network with a 'website' that teachers used to schedule recording times, capture specific moments, and subsequently view saved videos.
